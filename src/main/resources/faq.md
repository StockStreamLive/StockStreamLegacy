## FAQ
### Is this real money?
Yes. The stream above shows a live video capture of my brokerage account. Winning trades are executed through [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/).
If you would like to trade with more money, please donate to the experiment and additional funds will be added.

### How do I play?
There are three actions you may vote for: ***buy***, ***sell***, and ***hold***.

To play, simply type the action you would like to vote for followed by the stock you would like to apply it to.
For example:

***buy AAPL***

Every 60 seconds, the votes are counted and the command with the highest vote votes is executed.

Commands are not case-sensitive.

### What happens if there is a tie in the number of votes?
In the event of a tie The Game Engine will choose randomly between the top choices.

### Why does the Robinhood App feed show more than the spendable balance?
The account has been funded with an extra **$25,000** to avoid being suspended by Robinhood as a [Pattern Day Trader](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/217072366-Pattern-Day-Trading). The Game Engine is programmed to prevent this extra **$25,000** from being spent. Of course there are no bugs, so spending this extra cash is impossible.

### Are there any cheat codes?
Nope, don't waste your time looking for them.
