Each player who submits votes in the chat is automatically scored while they play.

Scores are calculated according to the following rules:

* At the end of each round, the trade you voted for the most times is stored for 5 minutes.
* After those 5 minutes, your trade will be scored based on the return on investment made by that trade.

##Example 1
>If your top voted trade is to **buy AAPL**, and AAPL increases by .03% five minutes after you vote, .03 will be **added** to your score. If it decreases by .03%, .03 will be **subtracted** from your score.


##Example 2
>If your top voted trade is to **sell AAPL**, and AAPL increases by .02% five minutes after you vote, .02 will be **subtracted** from your score. If it decreases by .02%, .02 will be **added** to your score.


**If your top vote is to sell a stock that is not in the Robinhood account or vote for a stock that is too expensive, your score will be zero for that round.**
